# Password Strength Validator

Ensure your passwords are secure with this intuitive, real-time password strength checker. This simple yet powerful web application evaluates your passwordâ€™s strength as you type, offering clear feedback and guidance on how to create strong, secure passwords to protect your online accounts.

## Key Features

- **Real-time password validation**: Instantly checks your password as you type, providing immediate feedback on:
  - Minimum password length of 12 characters
  - Inclusion of at least one lowercase letter
  - At least one uppercase letter
  - Inclusion of at least one number
  - At least one special character (e.g., `!@#$%^&*`)
- **Instant feedback**: Color-coded indicators guide you through the validation process, turning green for valid and red for unmet criteria, helping you understand password strength instantly.
- **Submit button activation**: The "Submit" button is enabled only when all password requirements are met, ensuring you create a secure password before submitting.
